Database Models
Your database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:

âœ… Category
    id - Integer - Doesn't allow null values -Set as primary key - Uses auto increment
    category_name - String - Doesn't allow null values

âœ… Product
    id - Integer - Doesn't allow null values - Set as primary key - Uses auto increment
    product_name - String - Doesn't allow null values
    price - Decimal - Doesn't allow null values - Validates that the value is a decimal
    stock - Integer - Doesn't allow null values - Set a default value of 10 - Validates that the value is numeric
    category_id - Integer - References the category model's id

âœ… Tag
    id - Integer - Doesn't allow null values - Set as primary key - Uses auto increment
    tag_name - String

âœ… ProductTag
    id - Integer - Doesn't allow null values - Set as primary key - Uses auto increment
    product_id - Integer - References the product model's id
    tag_id - Integer - References the tag model's id

Associations
You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:

âœ… Product belongs to Category, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

âœ… Category has many Product models.

âœ… Product belongs to many Tag models. Using the ProductTag through model, allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products.

âœ… Tag belongs to many Product models.
